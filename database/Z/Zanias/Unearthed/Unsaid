Here it comes again.
Here it comes again,
are you bringing me down or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down or are you all I have?

Here it comes again.
Here it comes again,
are you bringing me down or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down or are you all I have?

Here it comes again.
Here it comes again,
are you bringing me down or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down or are you all I have?

Here it comes again.
Here it comes again,
are you bringing me down or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down or are you all I have?

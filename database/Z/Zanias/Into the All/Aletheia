Guarded from the outside in
I caught your eye across the room
No surprise, it’s withering and cruel
And blood runs cold
Knowing what we had before
And it’s clear as it ever was
The truth of us

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
Divided, alone…
Ghosts in a shell

It’s so out of my control
These walls we can never dismantle
How could I have thought it possible
For scalp and skull to dissolve? To dissolve?

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
Untied, undone
Strangers still

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
(Divided, alone…)
Ghosts in a shell

This is who we are (this is who we are)
This is who we are
This is who we are

We were somewhere gone together
(This is who we are)
Now the fortress stands as high as ever

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
Untied and undone
Strangers still

This is who (we are, we are, we are)
This is who (we are)
This is who (we are)
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
